It has been a rough couple of months, but I am back and pushing through towards my goals. I was in a pretty significant car accident that rocked the boat for me physically, mentally, and financially. I pushed through my lessons, but with everything else going on in my life I had to take a step back. As hard as this was being so close to the finish line, I had the support of my Flatiron and personal network to help get me to where I can put my best foot forward.

This time has led me to refocus on what I have learned through  Flatiron so far and why I chose to transition into software development. 

**What I have learned?**

* Small steps lead to great strides.
* Observe, plan, execute to accomplish your end goal.
* There is always a solution to fix something that is broken.
* Small breaks are key to new perspectives.
* Everything clicks with practice.
* It is probably a typo.


**Why Software Development?**

* The ability to create.
* The fulfillment from problem solving.
* The desire for continued learning and personal growth.
* The contribution to something bigger than myself.
* The ability to improve human experience and interaction with technology.
* The continual growth and evolution of the industry.


Reflecting on these lessons and whys, continues to motivate and push me to my goals and overcome these obstacles in my personal life. I am running towards that finish line and will continue to jump those hurdles to obtain my first role in the dev world.
