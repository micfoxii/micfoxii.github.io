I never thought my first blog post would be an article of triumph, but unfortantely that is not the story I am about to tell. I had conquered the lessons and participated in my cohorts live coding exercises, and I was ready for the challenge to build my first Ruby CLI Gem. I was excited to learn and expected to push through every failure to come out on top with a complete project.

I took several days on our week off to think about what it was that I wanted to build exactly and came up with several ideas. My two main contenders were to scrape album reviews off of Pitchfork since I regularly use them to discover new music and the other was to collect beer reviews to discover new beers to enjoy. I decided to first tackle the Pitchfork website, but ran into some issues scraping due to the structure of the website. I thought to myself, no worries, on to Plan B, lets scrape some beers!

I didn't actually jump straight into that mindset. I spent quite a bit of time learning out to set up my first gem and build the structure of my CLI, but hey it was great practice because second time around it went much quicker. I got to building, watched videos, googled fixes, inserted fake data, and thought things were going pretty smoothly. Then it was like I hit a brick wall. Error after error, fix something and another thing broke, and the scraping that I felt so confident about from our lessons, I quickly learned was an entirely different beast in and of itself. However, I continued to google, and I kept pushing through. I spent more hours than I would like to admit, but I was determined not to give up.

Pushing through was not easy, but I persisted. However, through this experience, I learned a very valuable lesson. I am my own worst enemy. I allowed myself to get trapped in a negative, defeatist mindset too many times that left me crippled. I would sit and stare sometimes in fear of failure. I would freeze because I allowed myself to think I knew nothing. It was in those moments that I truly did not get anywhere, and when I got in those moments they were difficult to get out of. In a panic, I would frantically start changing things or attempt to refactor my code to make it look similar to a tutorial, and those changes without thinking I would lose myself completely in what I was doing and get myself stuck further. 

I am not proud of what I ultimately submitted, but I am proud that I learned some valuable lessons about myself, my mindset, and continued to push through even if I did not complete the assignment. I had issues on my second level scraper which did not get the information I wanted and created bugs. I had hoped to figure all of that out so I could proudly submit this project and even have time to refactor, but that is not the case. I even started to build a simple CLI to pull news articles in the last hour, but I decided to stop once I started scraping, because I am not going to give up. I am going to persist and continue to learn from what I have struggled with so far. From these failures, I think my mindset is going to come out stronger I finally noticed today that worrying was not productive and that I need to harness that into positive motivation. Hours of work in an anxious mindset did me no good, but I can fix that just like my code.

If anything this has taught me that I am persistent, I can be my own worst enemy, and that I want this. I am ready for the next failure, and I am ready to fix it!
