WOW! I am starting to see the real magic they were finally talking about. Like all project this far, the connections are all there in the labs and lessons, but putting it all together in the portfolio projects is an entirely difference feat. This project was a rollercoaster, but end the end you always enjoy the ride. I felt immense success and failure, and sometimes I was not quite sure what I was feeling. Finishing this project ended up giving me more confidence than I had going in.

My favorite part of the project was all of the ideas and applications that started flying through my head, and thinking about how to implement further. I wish I had spent more time adding more functionality and formatting, but building the basic code from the ground up feels like an accomplishment in and of itself. I also can't wait to fly through adding Omniauth the next time around.

I feel like I should get more technical, and I have said this previously, but I don't even know where to begin. Again, it will probably be left to another blog post. Two of the technical aspects of the project that I found most interesting were the Associations and Nested Routes, both would make informative posts. I should also probably check my last post to see what I thought to be an interesting topic. I need to up my technical blogging from this personal story!

The imposter syndrome is still lurking, and it grabbed me a few times throughout the project. **BUT** I learned how to bring it all together, and was able to grasp concepts more completely, improve my Googling, and implement code that I felt practical in the real world.
